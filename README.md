Data Modeling
In this SQL project, I will inspect 6 CSV files containing employee data and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables using Quick DBD.
Next, I import the CSV employee data into the tables.

Once the tables are set up, I perform data analysis on the 6 tables in pgAdmin.
